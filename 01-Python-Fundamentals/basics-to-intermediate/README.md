# 🐍 Basic to Intermediate Python for Data Science – My First Steps

Welcome to the **Basic Python to Intermediate** section of my Data Science journey!  
This folder contains essential Python concepts that are important for anyone starting in data science. They are the base for real-world tasks like data cleaning, automation, and logic building.\
