# 🐍 Basic Python for Data Science – My First Steps

Welcome to the **Basic Python** section of my Data Science journey!  
This folder contains essential Python concepts that are important for anyone starting in data science. These are not just simple codes — they are the base for real-world tasks like data cleaning, automation, and logic building.

## 🚧 Why Start with Python Basics?

Before working with data, I must understand how to:
- Write clear and correct Python code
- Think like a programmer (logical steps)
- Use Python to solve small real-life problems

These skills are needed when working with tools like Pandas, NumPy, or scikit-learn later on.

## 🧠 What You'll Learn Here

Each file in this folder teaches a concept that is often used in real-world data tasks:

| Topic               | Real-World Use Case Example                       |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Variables & Input  | Storing user data or values from a form          |
| If-Else Logic      | Making decisions (e.g. fraud detection rules)     |
| Loops              | Repeating tasks like reading many files           |
| Functions          | Writing reusable steps like cleaning data         |
| Strings            | Formatting reports or cleaning text data          |
| Lists & Dicts      | Handling JSON, CSV rows, or API results           |
| Sets & Tuples      | Unique data (like unique user IDs)                |

## 🗂 Folder Structure

Example file list (you can rename yours similarly):

- `01_variables_input.py` – collecting and storing input  
- `02_control_flow.py` – making decisions with if/else  
- `03_loops.py` – for and while loops  
- `04_functions.py` – writing reusable code blocks  
- `05_data_structures.py` – lists, dictionaries, sets, tuples  
- `06_string_operations.py` – cleaning and editing text  
- `07_basic_errors.py` – catching simple errors  
- `08_real_world_examples.py` – simple data-related problems

## 🌍 Real Examples (Mini Projects)

Some files may include:
- Bill calculator
- Student grade checker
- Simple chatbot
- Basic email/text formatter
- Word counter from a paragraph

These are simple now but help me build skills for bigger data science tasks later.

## 🧭 How This Fits My Data Science Path

This is **Level 1** of my learning. Here's my plan:

1. ✅ Basic Python (this folder)
2. 🔜 Intermediate Python (file I/O, error handling, OOP)
3. 🔜 Data Analysis with Pandas/NumPy
4. 🔜 Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
5. 🔜 Projects & Mini Case Studies
6. 🔜 ML Models & Deployments
